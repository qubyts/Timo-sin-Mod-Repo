# The Ghost Hunting Experience By WALLE89
This mod adds ghosts to minecraft each entity acts differently some are dangerous some are scary some are even just weird


## ENTITY 1 creepy
creepy is a creeper consumed by darkness his ony goal is to hunt and kill you
his ability is to give the player levitation for 2 seconds and explode the player if youre in a 16 block distance



### ENTITY 2 the masked
the masked while looking cool is generaly the worst entity in the mod he looks like a floating mask with a ton of eyes he is slow but if your in a 32 block range of him you will get slowness so it may be hard to outrun him hes also very powerful if you get to near hell spawm 2 clones having a small chance to even spawn a copy of himself he will give the player wither when to near thats how he damages you



#### ENTITY 3 The shadow from the fog/The follower
The follower is an entity that looks like a man with no head hes black too when he spawns he will silently teleport nearer the player how this system works is based of the one who watches he will from time to time get invisibility and the slowness effect will dissapear this is when he begins to move to the player when
the effect is over he will get slowness again and continue to stare and stalk the player



##### ENTITY 4 The puppet master/EyEs In ThE dArK/Gohast
the gohast is a monster which only has oe eye he floats and has no legs his hands are also floating he is the main ghost of the mod And isnt that special he is in early development and thats why but so far he will fly around your world when he sees a player hell attack the player he doesnt do anything else really though updates are comming to the mod




###### ARMOR
Along side having ghosts it does have some armor parts as well though not finished in any way and are pretty low quality its worth talking about still the first armor part is the creepdhat this item uses the power of the enity called creepy and gves you night vision when in dark areas this is added because creepy has glowing eyes it also lets you levetate by sneaking sneaking also grants the player slow falling might be good for surviving falls this is based of creepy having the ability to make players levetate also if youre in bright areas youl explode
floating boots use the power of the maksed and let the player fly based of the fact that the masked can fly it does nothing else
the following chestplate is a chestplate that lets the player break blocks by walking into them but it doesnt work right now it also gives the player resistance while sneaking
