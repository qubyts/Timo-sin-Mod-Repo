# README for Mods Directory

This directory contains all the mod files (.jar) that can be installed for Minecraft. 

## Adding New Mods

To add a new mod to this directory, simply place the .jar file into the `mods` folder. Ensure that the mod is compatible with the version of Minecraft you are using.

## Installation Requirements

Before installing mods, make sure you have the following:

- A compatible version of Minecraft.
- The necessary mod loader (e.g., Forge or Fabric) installed.
- Python installed on your system to run the installation script.

## Installation Process

Run the `install_mods.py` script located in the `src` directory. This script will scan the `mods` directory for any .jar files and handle the installation process automatically. 

Make sure to check the console output for any errors or messages during the installation.
